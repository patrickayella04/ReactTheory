// Preferably we want to store any app level state, such as our Users, in our app.js(since we are not currently using context or redux, we dont have a centralised store for state, the next best thing is to have it stored in your app.js) This way we can easily send state down to components through props. 

// We create a life cycle method - ComponentDidMount - this will run when the component mounts. React Lifecycle methods are the series of events that happen from the starting of a React component to its ending. 3. componentDidMount()
//ComponentDidMount - 
// Now the component has been mounted. This is the time where the next lifecycle method componentDidMount come in to play.

// This method is named as soon because the component is mounted and prepared. This is the best place to initiate API calls in order to fetch data from remote servers. In this method, you can use setState which will cause another rendering but It will happen before the browser updates the UI. This is to ensure that the user wonâ€™t see the intermediate state.
